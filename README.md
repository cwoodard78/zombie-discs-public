# Zombie Discs

Zombie Discs is a web application built for the disc golf community to help recover lost discs and return them to their rightful owners. Players can log lost or found discs, set reward bounties, view matches based on color, location, and mold similarity, and communicate directly with each other through a built-in messaging system.

The platform features automatic disc matching logic, interactive maps, search and filtering tools, and user profile management â€” all designed to make disc recovery easy, community-driven, and rewarding.

## Features

- Log Lost or Found discs with optional photos and GPS location
- Optionally offer a reward for returning lost discs
- Intelligent disc matching algorithm based on color, type, mold, manufacturer, and proximity
- View matched discs and message the other user via a private inbox system
- View your active and archived discs on an interactive map
- Leaderboards for most discs lost, found, karma given, and rewards earned/offered
- Authentication, user profiles, and edit/delete controls for your own discs
- REST API endpoints for key data (discs, stats, map)
