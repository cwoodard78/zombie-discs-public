        "question": "How does matching work?",
        "answer": "The database is searched as soon as new records are added for discs that closely match your listing (color, mold, location, and notes). If there's a potential match, you'll get a notification under My Discs, with a 'New!' badge and match count."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when a match is found?",
        "answer": "You’ll see a 'New!' badge next to your disc in 'My Discs', and you’ll receive a message if someone tries to contact you about the match."
